# Embedded Programming for STM32 Chips
Source code and firmware for STM32 embedded systems. Educational project based on LowByteProductions' bare-metal-series project.

To get started with c libraries: 
- git submodule add <url> to add new modules
- git submodule init && git submodule update
- Install Arm-GNU-Toolchain on Windows or Unix
- Make sure c_cpp_properties.json has the correct compilerPath specified!
	- Different for Windows, MacOS and Linux

- Makefile and launch.json may require editing as the project scales
