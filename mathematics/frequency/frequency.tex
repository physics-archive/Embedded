\subsection*{Default and Delayed Frequencies}
%Math
\large
If the firmware's only instruction is to blink an LED on the board,
the blinking won't be visible at its core 
frequency ($f$) of 84MHz. We want to observe the blinking 
with natural vision, so the solution 
is to add cycle delays ($N_d$) to produce a new, 
significantly-reduced frequency ($f'$).\\[1 ex]

$$f = \frac{N}{t} = 84,000,000 \frac{cycles}{second}\\[3 ex]$$

$$f' = \frac{N'}{t} = \frac{N/N_d}{t}\\[3 ex]$$

*$f'$ is controllable, as opposed to $f$ which is determined by the chip's architecture.\\[1 ex]

\large
\begin{flushleft}
Initial implementation of cycle delays could be achieved
with a 
for loop that executes only one, null instruction. At first 
glance, iterating ($i = 0;\ i < N;\ i++$)
gives us $N = N_d = 84\ million\ cycles$.\\[1 ex]

Observing the LED after a firmware update, it's clear that the order of magnitude is approximately correct, 
yet $f'$ is 4-5 times smaller than expected. Why is this the case 
if our application runs at 84MHz and our for loop executes only one command?\\[1 ex]

\end{flushleft}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemindent}{0.4in}
    \item The application is running on the system at $N$ cycles per second, 
    but each iteration of our for loop 
    costs more than 1 cycle. 
    \item $N$ iterations of an empty $for loop$ costs $cN$ cycles, where $c$ is an integer satisfying $c > 1$.
\end{itemize}

$$N_d \neq N$$

%Another way to write this would be to isolate our target frequency, $f'$, to emphasize our goal of controlling the LED blink frequency.

%Dr. M. style and obtain a realistic solutio but don't use it.

\begin{flushleft}
    This method has lost its potential for accuracy, and the best option is to move on.
